## Project: 0x02-shell_redirections

In this project, I learned about:
- Shell redirections (>, >>, <)
- Piping (|)
- Common filters like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sort`, `uniq`
- Printing to standard output

Each script in the `0x02-shell_redirections` directory performs a specific function described in the task instructions.
